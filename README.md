# BIT-fitness-certificate
This project outlines the concept of a Fitness Certificate (FC) portal designed for colleges. The portal's primary objective is to facilitate venue fitness checking, wherein college administrators can log in, provide updates about various venue categories through yes/no type questions, and receive alerts regarding non-compliance issues.
